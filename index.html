            <p class="col-lg-8 bio">Welcome to my profile page! I'm currently studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a sophomore, and I plan on graduating in the fall of 2022. I'm still deciding what I want to cover, but I'm using my time in college to explore different opportunities. However, the two that interest me most are sports and politics.
                <br><br>I was born on Long Island and have lived there my entire life. I grew up watching the New York Islanders hockey club, which inspired my love of sports and later sports journalism. I've dreamt of being in the broadcast booth and calling live NHL games on TV and creating relationships with some of my favorite players. But once I started college, I caught the political bug. I started to dive into my journalism classes in 2020, while the country sank into a pandemic and we experienced one of the fiercest electon cycles in history.
                <br><br>Since before college, I've written for a New York Islanders blog known as Drive4Five. I currently write weekly articles for the site, and have joined the editing team in recent months. I've also done reporting for UMD newspapers like The Mitzpeh, as well as reported on local politics for my journalism class. Hopefully this site can shed light on my experience as an emerging journalist.</p>
