<h1>Air Travel During<br>COVID-19</h1>
<h2 class="byline">By Ben Baruch</h2>
</div>

<div class="offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">
<p>There might not be a better petri dish for COVID-19 than a metal tube with people spread mere inches apart, so the airline industry had to pivot when the global pandemic stifled demand for air travel amid fears of spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Governments across the globe restricted access to travelers, so there was nowhere to go. Even if a destination was open, airlines couldn’t even fill planes to capacity, even if demand permitted, as social distancing measures required carriers to block middle seats.</p>
<p>Now, over a year after the virus made its way to North America, airlines are learning how to deal with flying during the pandemic. Despite the unprecedented struggles, some airlines were able to employ some creative thinking to help them stay competitive.</p>
</div> 

<div>
<h2>New Destinations</h2> 
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-7">
<p>In 2019, Los Angeles International Airport appeared four times on that year’s list of the busiest North American domestic air routes. Most domestic flights that year connected Los Angeles to San Francisco. The second most were between Los Angeles and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. The airport also ranked fourth and seventh for routes between Las Vegas and Seattle, respectively.</p> 
<p>The airport appeared only twice in the top 10 in April 2021, and the route between powerhouse cities Los Angeles and San Francisco is nowhere to be found. The trend in 2021 is Atlanta to somewhere in Florida.</p>
<p>Florida makes sense. Known for its lax COVID-19 restrictions, tourists have flocked to the sunshine state to escape lockdowns and restrictions elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-lg-6">
<p>But why Atlanta? The list that’s being referenced here only takes into account where the airplane takes off and lands, not where people end up. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the main hub of Delta Airlines, the largest airline in the U.S. The airport saw over 1000 Delta flights per day serving over 200 destinations across the globe in 2019.</p> 
<p>The trend is true for international travel as well. In 2019, two New York-based routes appeared on the top 20 overall. In seventh place was New York's LaGuardia Airport to Toronto Pearson and in 13th was JFK to London Heathrow. Although JFK made the top 10 twice in April 2021, the destinations are Santiago and Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>This year, the busiest North American international routes are littered with Mexican and Carribean destinations, representing the strength of leisure travel during the post-pandemic rebound. In fact, Orlando to San Juan, Puerto Rico, was the busiest international (as classified by OAG) route in the world in April 2021.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>A Focus on Leisure Travel</h2> 
<div class="row">
<div class="offset-lg-6 col-lg-6">
<p>The changes in destinations hinted at it, but business travel has lagged as air travel starts to pick up again.</p>
<p>But a report from Statista shows that it was never a growing market. Between 2008 and 2019, there were never less than 439.2 million business trips and never more than 464 million. During that same period, leisure trips increased steadily from 1.5 billion in 2008 to 1.85 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>However, many airlines, especially full service carries like Delta, United and American, make most of their money off business travelers since they tend to pay high, last minute prices for already expensive business class seats. Tourists, on the other hand, tend to look for the cheapest prices and book farther in advance.</p>
<p>So while the shift to Zoom and telework has led to less demand for business travel, being cooped up has made everyday American even more willing to take a vacation. The aforementioned study forecasted that after the 2020 industry downturn, leisure and business travel numbers would start to resemble pre-pandemic levels by 2022.</p>
</div>

<div> 
<h2>Leisure Airlines Benefitting</h2>
<p>Even before the pandemic started, some airlines were better equipped to handle surges of leisure travelers. You can essentially divide airlines into two classes, full service or low cost. In the United States, Delta, American and United are considered full service carriers. They charge higher prices, but give you more for your money. Most flights on full service carriers have more legroom, snacks (or even a meal), in-flight entertainment, and maybe even free checked bags.</p>
<p>That's not the case on low cost carriers, such as Southwest, Spirit, and JetBlue. Their cabins are almost entirely geared towards economy class travelers. You won't find business class on Southwest or Spirit. The latter doesn't even have reclining seats, let alone TVs behind them. But if it means paying less to get from A to B, passenegers going on vacation will likely deal with two to four miserable hours on a plane in exchange for the destination it will take them to. The post-pandemic travel rebound has proven this to be true.</p> 
<p>Take Southwest Airlines, for example. On April 9, a share of the airline's stock cost $63.42, the higest it's been since 2018. The low-cost carrier offers only economy class, no Wi-Fi, no in-flight entertainment and no power outlets. The same is true for other low cost carriers like Allegiant and JetBlue. The only exception is Spirit Airlines.</p>
<p>On the contrary, legacy carriers Delta, American and United stock prices are all well below February 2020 levels. They are all global airlines that had to deal with border closings and the near extinction of business travel, a major source of revenue for full service airlines.</p>
</div>

<div> 
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>As of April 2021, nearly 30% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and airlines are seeing pent up demand for both leisure and business travel. For now, particularly this summer, airlines will be focusing heavy on leisure travel.</p>
<p>Even though this summer seems promising for air travel, airlines aren't completely out of the woods yet. Southwest's earnings per share and revenue numbers from the first quarter of 2021 are a far cry from where they were two years ago, which is true for all the airlines that have released their earnings so far.</p>
<p>Though that doesn't mean we can't have hope. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told CNBC in April that the airline plans to return service to 85% of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2021, hoping to capitalize on good vaccination numbers and demand for travel.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness people are getting vaccinated and thank goodness people are ready to get back to their lives and move about the country," he said.</p>
<p>Even American Airlines CEO Doug Parker admitted his company will be focusing on leisure markets this summer.</p>
<p>"We've retired about 10% of our aircraft so even if we're flying all of our airplanes we'll be flying about 10% smaller" he said referring to pre-pandemic volume. "We certainly will be flying more to leisure markets because those are the people traveling the most today for certain."</p>
<p>So when you're ready to take a summer vacation, the airline industry will be ready to get you there.</p>
