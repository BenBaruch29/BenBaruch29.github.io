        <h1>Air Travel's Recovery From<br>COVID-19<br>
            <span class="byline">By Ben Baruch</span>
        </h1>

        <div class="offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">
            <p>Over a year after COVID-19 made its way to North America, airlines learned how to deal with flying during the pandemic. Despite the unprecedented struggles, some airlines were able to employ some creative thinking to help them stay competitive.</p>
            <p>There might not be a better petri dish for the virus than a metal tube with people spread mere inches apart, so the airline industry had to pivot when the global pandemic stifled demand for air travel amid fears of spreading the virus.</p>
            <p>Governments across the globe restricted access to travelers, so there was nowhere to go. If a destination was open and demand permitted, airlines couldn’t even fill planes to capacity as social distancing measures required carriers to block middle seats.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>New Destinations</h2>
            <div class="blue_box row">
                <div class="col-xxl-6">
                    <p>In 2019, Los Angeles International Airport appeared four times on that year’s list of the busiest North American domestic air routes. Most domestic flights that year connected Los Angeles to San Francisco. The second most were between Los Angeles and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. The airport also ranked fourth and seventh for routes between Las Vegas and Seattle, respectively.</p>
                    <p>The airport appeared only twice in the top 10 in April 2021, and the route between powerhouse cities Los Angeles and San Francisco is nowhere to be found. The trend in 2021 has been flights between Atlanta and somewhere in Florida.</p>
                    <p>Florida makes sense. On Sept. 25, 2020, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2020/states-mask-mandates-coronavirus.html#Florida" target="_blank">Gov. Ron DeSantis barred municipalities from collecting fines and penalties for local mask mandates.</a> Tourists have flocked to the sunshine state to escape COVID-19 related lockdowns and restrictions elsewhere in the U.S.</p>
                </div>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>But why Atlanta? Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the main hub of Delta Airlines, the largest airline by revenue in January 2020. The airport handled over 1000 Delta flights per day serving over 200 destinations across the globe in 2019.</p>
            <p>This likely means that flocks of people are connecting through Atlanta in order to reach their final destination in Florida.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xl-6">
                    <p>There’s a similar trend in international travel. <a href="https://www.oag.com/hubfs/Free_Reports/Busiest%20Routes/2019/busiest-routes-2019.pdf?hsCtaTracking=ee97d32f-97c9-4625-8a07-481cf63877c5%7C559f8381-6032-446d-9b62-6c16ff1f4bad" target="_blank">In 2019</a>, two New York-based routes appeared on the top 20 overall. In seventh place was New York's LaGuardia Airport to Toronto Pearson and in 13th was JFK to London Heathrow. Although JFK made the top 10 twice in April 2021, the destinations are Santiago and Santo Domingo.</p>
                    <p>This year, the busiest North American international routes are littered with Mexican and Caribbean destinations, representing the strength of leisure travel during the post-pandemic rebound. In fact, Orlando to San Juan, Puerto Rico, was the busiest international (as classified by OAG) route in the world in April 2021.</p>

            <h2>A Focus on Leisure Travel</h2>
            <div class="blue_box">
                <p>The changes in destinations hinted at it, but business travel has lagged as air travel starts to pick up again.</p>
                <p>But a report from Statista shows that it was never a growing market. Between 2008 and 2019, there were never less than 439.2 million business trips and never more than 464 million. During that same period, leisure trips increased steadily from 1.5 billion in 2008 to 1.85 billion in 2019.</p>

                <script type="text/javascript">
                ! function() { "use strict";
                    window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
                            for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px") } })) }();
                </script>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xl-6">
                    <p>However, many airlines, especially full-service carriers like Delta, United and American, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/deltas-coach-revenue-less-important-as-premium-class-demand-surges.html" target="_blank">make most of their money off business travelers</a> since they tend to pay high, last-minute prices for already expensive business class seats. Tourists, on the other hand, tend to look for the cheapest prices and book farther in advance.</p>
                    <p>So while the shift to Zoom and telework has led to less demand for business travel, being cooped up has made everyday Americans even more willing to take a vacation. Leisure travel will continue to dominate, but airlines will get their coveted business travelers back again. </p>

            <h2>Leisure Airlines Benefitting</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xl-7">
                    <p>Even before the pandemic started, some airlines were better equipped to handle surges of leisure travelers. Low-cost airlines, like Southwest, Spirit or JetBlue didn’t suffer as much as full-service carriers since they lost less revenue to business class travelers.</p>
                    <p>Take Southwest Airlines, for example. On April 9, a share of the airline's stock cost $63.42, the highest it's been since 2018. Other low-cost airlines like Allegiant and JetBlue are seeing their stock price rebound too.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, stock prices for legacy carriers Delta, American and United are all well below February 2020 levels.</p>

                    window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <div class="blue_box">
                <p>As of April 2021, nearly 30% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and airlines are seeing pent up demand for both leisure and business travel. For now, particularly this summer, airlines will be focusing heavy on leisure travel.</p>
                <p>However, airlines aren't completely out of the woods yet. Southwest's earnings per share and revenue numbers from the first quarter of 2021 are a far cry from where they were two years ago, which is true for all the airlines that have released their first-quarter earnings so far.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>Still, that doesn't mean we can't have hope. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/southwest-airlines-luv-and-american-airlines-aal.html" target="_blank">Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told CNBC in April</a> that the airline plans to return service to 85% of pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2021, hoping to capitalize on good vaccination numbers and demand for travel.</p>
                    <p>"Thank goodness people are getting vaccinated and thank goodness people are ready to get back to their lives and move about the country," he said.</p>
                    <p>Even American Airlines CEO Doug Parker admitted his company will be focusing on leisure markets this summer.</p>
                    <p>"We've retired about 10% of our aircraft so even if we're flying all of our airplanes we'll be flying about 10% smaller," he said referring to pre-pandemic volume. "We certainly will be flying more to leisure markets because those are the people traveling the most today for certain."</p>

                <p class="close offset-lg-3 col-lg-6">So when you're ready to take a summer vacation, the airline industry will be ready to get you there.</p>
